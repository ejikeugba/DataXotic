      <description>Amazon&#39;s e-commerce platform is one of the biggest online shopping platforms globally. Considering its large customer base with an unprecedented amount of data on user experience, trying to summarize or understand the underlying pattern of available reviews could be a very daunting task.
Sentiment analysis or opinion mining provides an analytical procedure for extracting the hidden polarities in a given body of text. It offers a powerful tool for detecting the nature of opinion reflected in documents, websites, social media feeds, etc.</description>

      <description>Scrambling for features!
To build a great machine learning model, it is very crucial to determine which features are the most important. Even after the data is cleaned and preprocessed, most algorithms perform better when fed with enginnered features that are specifically made to enhance the predictive properties of the dataset. A useful rule of thumb is that a fearture must have a relationship to the target in other to learn properly.</description>

      <description>Bundling codes!
Software packages are an ideal way to bundle together and distribute codes and data for re-use in any given application. This can help improve productivity while also saving a lot of time.
We employ standard IDEs to build and maintain user-friendly packages that could be deployed to production and in empirical research. Debugging services for existing problematic codes are also provided. Any or all of the following are possible:</description>

      <description>About Heading Smoothing in Ordinal Regression: An Application to Sensory Data The so-called proportional odds assumption is popular in cumulative, ordinal regression. In practice, however, such an assumption is sometimes too restrictive. For instance, when modeling the perception of boar taint on an individual level, it turns out that, at least for some subjects, the effects of predictors (androstenone and skatole) vary between response categories. For more flexible modeling, we consider the use of a ‘smooth-effects-on-response penalty’ (SERP) as a connecting link between proportional and fully non-proportional odds models, assuming that parameters of the latter vary smoothly over response categories.</description>
