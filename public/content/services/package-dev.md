Bundling codes!

Software packages are an ideal way to bundle together and distribute codes and data for re-use in any given application. This can help improve productivity while also saving a lot of time.

We employ standard IDEs to build and maintain user-friendly packages that could be deployed to production and in empirical research. Debugging services for existing problematic codes are also provided. Any or all of the following are possible:

- pkg with IDE (Rstudio)
- pkg documentation (roxygen)
- debug problematic codes
- unit testing (testthat)
- create git repo
- archive in open source repo (CRAN, zenodo, etc)
- publish in open source journal (JOSS)

With us you can be assured of an efficient software development projects!
