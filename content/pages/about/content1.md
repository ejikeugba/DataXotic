##### Hi!
My name is Ejike Ugba, a consulting data scientist, researcher and CEO of DataXotic. I am currently part of a [research group](https://www.hsu-hh.de/statdat/en/research) at the Chair of Statistics and Data Science HSU Hamburg. We use advanced statistical modelling approaches to proffer solutions to problems often encountered while using some particular class of models in empirical studies ([see Publications](/research/)).

My team at DataXotic is available to provide timely and accurate solutions to real-world data science/analytic problems. We have hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms, advanced data science procedures and many more. We have worked on various such projects in past with great success ([see projects](/project/)). We ensure to deliver neat and insightful results in all our projects, as well as passionate about working with both individuals and organizations that would want to make effective use of their data.
Feel free to [contact us](/contact/) to discuss both short and longer-term projects. We look forward to being of service to you.
