My name is Ejike, a consulting data scientist and researcher with a solid background in statistics and machine learning. I currently work in a [research group](https://www.hsu-hh.de/statdat/en/research) at the Chair of Statistics and Data
Science HSU Hamburg, while also providing data science consulting with my team at DataXotic.

I have hands-on experience in implementing machine learning algorithms and data science roles in general. Iâ€™ve worked on various data science/analytics projects with great success
([see projects](/project/)). I am passionate about working with organizations that want to make effective use of their data. Feel free to contact me and to discuss both short and longer-term projects.
