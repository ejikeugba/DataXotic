### [Smoothing in Ordinal Regression: An Application to Sensory Data](https://doi.org/10.3390/stats4030037)

The so-called proportional odds assumption is popular in cumulative, ordinal regression. In practice, however, such an assumption is sometimes too restrictive. For instance, when modeling the perception of boar taint on an individual level, it turns out that, at least for some subjects, the effects of predictors (androstenone and skatole) vary between response categories. For more flexible modeling, we consider the use of a ‘smooth-effects-on-response penalty’ (SERP) as a connecting link between proportional and fully non-proportional odds models, assuming that parameters of the latter vary smoothly over response categories. The usefulness of SERP is further demonstrated through a simulation study. Besides flexible and accurate modeling, SERP also enables fitting of parameters in cases where the pure, unpenalized non-proportional odds model fails to converge.

### [serp: An R package for smoothing in ordinal regression](https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03705)

The use of specialized methods for the analysis of categorical data has been on the rise in recentyears (Agresti, 2010). For instance, scientists frequently use the different forms of the ordinalmodel to analyze relationships between an ordinal response variable and covariates of interest.In particular, the cumulative link model (CLM) propagated by McCullagh (1980) finds a widerange of empirical applications in clinical trials, social surveys, market research, etc. However,in high-dimensional settings with a large number of unknown parameters, e.g., if severalpotential predictors and response categories are modeled, the so-called identification problemcould be somewhat unavoidable (Bartels, 1985; Fisher, 1966). Thankfully, regularizationtechniques (see, e.g., Bühlmann & Van de Geer, 2011; Hastie et al., 2009) among therapproaches, offer a remedy in such situations.

### [A Modification of McFadden's R2 for Binary and Ordinal Response Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01301)

A lot of studies on the summary measures of predictive strength of categorical response models consider the Likelihood Ratio Index (LRI), also known as the McFadden-R2, a better option than many other measures. We propose a simple modification of the LRI that adjusts for the effect of the number of response categories on the measure and that also rescales its values, mimicking an underlying latent measure. The modified measure is applicable to both binary and ordinal response models fitted by maximum likelihood. Results from simulation studies and a real data example on the olfactory perception of boar taint show that the proposed measure outperforms most of the widely used goodness-of-fit measures for binary and ordinal models. The proposed R2 interestingly proves quite invariant to an increasing number of response categories of an ordinal model.

### [gofcat: Goodness-of-Fit Measures for Categorical Response Models](https://cran.r-project.org/package=gofcat)

A post-estimation method for categorical response models (CRM). Inputs from objects of class serp(), clm(), polr(), multinom(), mlogit(), vglm() and glm() are currently supported. Available tests include the Hosmer-Lemeshow tests for the binary, multinomial and ordinal logistic regression; the Lipsitz and the Pulkstenis-Robinson tests for the ordinal models. The proportional odds, adjacent-category, and constrained continuation-ratio models are particularly supported at ordinal level. Tests for the proportional odds assumptions in ordinal models are also possible with the Brant and the Likelihood-Ratio tests. Moreover, several summary measures of predictive strength (Pseudo R-squared), and some useful error metrics, including, the brier score, misclassification rate and logloss are also available for the binary, multinomial and ordinal models.
