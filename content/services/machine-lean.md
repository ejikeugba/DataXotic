What Algorithm!

Have you been searching for someone to support you with machine learning tasks in Python/R, you've arrived at the right place. We employ ML techniques to devise complex models and algorithms that lead to great prediction. our implemented algorithms enables you to produce reliable, and repeatable decisions, as well as uncover “hidden insights” through learning from historical relationships and trends in the data set.

We invest quality time to design pipelines to improve the quality of machine learning problems, use advanced techniques for model validation, and build state-of-the-art models that improve productivity and profits. Our services include:

- Supervised machine learning
- Regularization (Lasso, ridge, elastic net, etc)
- Regression
- Classification
- Clustering (unsupervised machine learning)
- Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
- Data Preprocessing
- Time-Series Analysis
- Semantic Analysis
- Text Classification

Algorithms : Decision Tress, Linear Regression, Naive Bayes, Neural Networks, SVMs, Nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Rule Learning, Bagging, Boosting etc.

You can be assured of a custom ML based solutions and projects, with end-to-end ML pipelines, right from data ingestion to prediction and evaluation.
