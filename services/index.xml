      <description>Scrambling for features!
To build a great machine learning model, it is very crucial to determine which features are the most important. Even after the data is cleaned and preprocessed, most algorithms perform better when fed with enginnered features that are specifically made to enhance the predictive properties of the dataset. A useful rule of thumb is that a fearture must have a relationship to the target in other to learn properly.</description>

      <description>Bundling codes!
Software packages are an ideal way to bundle together and distribute codes and data for re-use in any given application. This can help improve productivity while also saving a lot of time.
We employ standard IDEs to build and maintain user-friendly packages that could be deployed to production and in empirical research. Debugging services for existing problematic codes are also provided. Any or all of the following are possible:</description>
